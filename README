This repository contains some CMSSW code and configurations relevant to the summer project 
on timing with PPS @ HL-LHC. 

A) The GEN-SIM, RECO, MINIAOD processing follows the CMSSW_11_2_0_pre9 full simulation setup of:

      https://github.com/cms-pepr/production_tests

   Modified to take a physics signal sample (gammagamma->mu+mu-) from LHE input. 
   The config files corresponding to the 3 steps of the production are: 
   
	- GSD.py  
   	- RECO.py
   	- MINIAOD.py

   The equivalent configurations, with all of the imports expanded into a single file, are:

       - GSD_expand.py  
       - RECO_expand.py
       - MINIAOD_expand.py  

B) The final ROOT ntuples are made from MiniAOD, based on the 11_2_X_snowmass branch of: 

   https://github.com/recotoolsbenchmarks/RecoNtuplizer/tree/11_2_X_snowmass/TreeMaker/Ntuplzr

   On top of that, a few small modifications have been made to add information about the generator-level protons 
   from signal and pileup, and the true collision time of the signal vertex. The modified files are: 

   	- myproduceNtuples_cfg.py (main config file to run the analyzer)
	- Validator_cfi.py        (default parameter values)
	- Validator.cc  	  (main C++ file to access the data and fill ntuple branches)

   In order to get the generated signal protons correctly saved, the parameter "isSignalMC" should be set appropriately, 
   depending on whether the input is signal or background.
